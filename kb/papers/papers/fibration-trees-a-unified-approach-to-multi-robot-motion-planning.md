## Abstract

State space projections and decompositions have emerged as powerful tools to tackle the curse of dimensionality in high-dimensional, multi-robot motion planning problems. However, existing methods lack a unified framework which seamlessly handles combinations of projections (prioritization or task-space) and decompositions (parallel or decoupled subspaces). To fill this gap, we introduce fibration trees, which are trees consisting of state spaces as nodes and fibrations as edges, whereby a fibration models a projection from a higher-dimensional space to a lower-dimensional (or simplified) space. By modeling projections as fibrations, we unify sequential prioritization, parallel decomposition, and task-space projections under a single, coherent formalism. Building on this, we develop the rapidly-exploring random fibration trees (Fibration-RRT) planner, a sampling-based motion planner that generalizes strategies from quotient-space RRT (for sequential prioritizations) and discrete RRT (for parallel decompositions), while allowing the inclusion of task-space projections. Fibration-RRT operates on user-defined fibration trees and is proven to be probabilistically complete. To test the generality and efficiency of Fibration-RRT, we provide an open-source implementation and conduct experiments on 32 scenarios using multi robot teams with up to 96 degrees of freedom. Our results indicate that Fibration-RRT efficiently solves high-dimensional problems by exploiting user-defined fibration trees, thereby establishing fibration trees as a powerful, unified framework for multi-robot motion planning.
